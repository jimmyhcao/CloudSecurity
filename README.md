<h1> Project: Building a Secure Cloud ☁️ Network with VMs and Containers</h1>
<br>
In an age of cloud dominance, safeguarding your network is paramount. Our GitHub project focuses on creating a robust cloud network using VMs and containers. This project equips IT professionals, developers, and cybersecurity enthusiasts with knowledge and tools to secure cloud operations. This introduction outlines the project's significance, explores cloud networking, VMs, containers, and cybersecurity, and sets the stage for our comprehensive resources and tutorials. Join us to build a safer digital world where innovation and security thrive together.

<br>This project will cover the following tools and services<br>

<li>Microsoft Azure
<li>Docker
<li>Ansible
</li>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
To get our project kicked off, we will need to create and sign into out Microsoft Azure account. After which we will create a <b>Resource Group</b>
<br>
<h3>Resource Groups</h3>
Azure resource groups organize related resources for a project, making them easily identifiable by name. They encompass all the necessary elements, such as networks, firewalls, and virtual computers.

<h3>Virtual Network</h3>
A virtual network, often called a VLAN or VPN, creates isolated network segments within a physical network for improved management and security. Azure Virtual Network is Microsoft Azure's service for secure, isolated cloud networks, enabling control over IPs, subnets, and security for connecting Azure services like VMs, databases, and web apps.

<br>Creating a virtual network would be the next step in this project
