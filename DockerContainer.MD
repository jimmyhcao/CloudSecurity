<h1>Setting Up Docker Containers</h1>
<br>A container in the cloud is a lightweight, standalone, and portable environment that packages an application along with its dependencies, allowing it to run consistently across different cloud infrastructure and computing environments. Containers enable efficient deployment, scaling, and management of software applications in the cloud by isolating them from the underlying infrastructure and ensuring consistent execution regardless of where they are deployed.

<br>During this phase of the project, we will be setting up Docker on our Jump Box so we can install containers on it. Docker will enable us to efficiently manage and deploy containers, making our applications more portable and easier to scale. Once Docker is configured on the Jump Box, we will proceed to containerize and deploy our applications, streamlining the deployment process and ensuring consistency across different environments.
