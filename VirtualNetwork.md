<br><li>Azure subscription should automatically be selected as well as the same resource group created in the previous step. Name your virtual network something that you can easily distinguish it apart from other virtual networks to avoid confusion. We will name this virtual network <b>HomeLABVN</b>. *Note: Choose a region that you can easily remember. Every resource you create after this must be created in the exact same region. </li>
